                    <h2> Minestrone</h2>
                    <p>Minestrone is the ubiquitous Italian soup, made up of different kinds of seasonal chopped
                        vegetables
                        often paired with potatoes, beans and mushrooms. They're always lightly cooked so they retain a
                        little
                        bite, which helps make the broth more substantial</p>

                    <h2>cooked steak</h2>

                    <p> A steak is a meat generally sliced across the muscle fibers, potentially including a bone. It is
                        normally grilled, though can also be pan-fried. It is often grilled in an attempt to replicate
                        the
                        flavor of steak cooked over the glowing coals of an open fire. </p>

                    <h2>Special soup </h2>
                    <p> SPECIALTY SOUPS are made in with unusual ingredients or methods, such as cold, fruit soup,
                        turtle
                        soup,
                        or peanut soup. Sometimes cold soups are considered special soups even though they are basically
                        cold
                        versions of a clear or thick soup</p>
